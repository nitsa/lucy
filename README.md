# Introduction
Lucy is a pentesting script for information collection using an existing arbitrary file download vulnerability.

# Installation
Please read install.txt for prerequisites and how to run.

# Useful information
Script uses Tor and a list of pre-defined user agents to set up identity. User agents are in /templates/template.useragent file. Identity will change after 50 to 100 requests by default. You may change these limits by modifying rnd_min, rnd_max values in lucy.py. You may change sleep value between requests by modifying sleep_req value, in case of multiple requests. Files to be scanned are grouped by functionality (eg. os, network, processes) and are under /mods folder. Script /various/usergen.py may use /templates/template.userprofile with one more file to create a list of user profile files to scan. Target url should be in uri file, please check the example uri file. Tool saves collected information under /downloads folder.
